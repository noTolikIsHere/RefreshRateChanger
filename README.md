# RefreshRateChanger
Simple util that detects wheather you laptop is plugged/unplugged and reduces/increases your screen refresh rate and brightness

No config right now, you have to manually edit code: change these values:

- byte pluggedBrightness = 100; //brightness when plugged in
- byte unpluggedBrightness = 70; //brightness when not plugged in
- Int32 pluggedRefreshRate = 165; //refresh rate when plugged in
- Int32 unpluggedRefreshRate = 60; //refresh rate when not plugged in

You can also add executable to task scheduler. Here are my screens of how to config this task:
